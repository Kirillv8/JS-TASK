Task: Palindrome Checker

Description

This module implements a function to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, sequence of characters, or number that reads the same backward as forward.

Requirements

The function must correctly handle the following cases:

Case Insensitivity: The function must ignore the case of letters. For example, 'RaceCar' should be identified as a palindrome.

Ignore Punctuation and Spaces: The function must ignore punctuation, spaces, and special characters. For example, 'A man, a plan, a canal: Panama' should be identified as a palindrome.

Output: The function should return true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
